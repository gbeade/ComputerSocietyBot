# ComputerSocietyBot
A Discord bot for IEEE's Computer Society chapter @ ITBA, Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

## Setting up the bot in a Discord server
Authorize the bot at https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=943286355281207347&permissions=1249785670769&scope=bot and select a server. 

## Starting the bot 
Pull and and run main.py in https://replit.com/join/kbtdgynilq-gonzalomanuelma. A future version will allow the bot to run forever, but for now the bot must be manually booted after one hour of inactivity. The replit acts as a server so that it depends on no computer and can be turned on/off from anywhere. 

## Using the bot 
All commands are prefixed by a '$' symbol. 

### Debugging
- $inspire: replies with a motivational phrase 

### CSXP 
CSXP refers to Computer Society's Experience Points. CSXP can be tracked by, awarded to or removed from any user in the server where the bot has been set up. 
- $csxp: replies with the sender's current CSXP. 
- $csxp leaderboard: replies with the server's members' CSXP.
- $csxp faucet: gives the user 1 CSXP
- $csxp gamble <q>: bets q units of CSXP with a 0.5 chance of doubling and a .5 chance of losing.
