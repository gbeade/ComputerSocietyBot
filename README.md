# ComputerSocietyBot
A Discord bot for IEEE's Computer Society chapter @ ITBA, Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

## Setting up the bot in a Discord server
Authorize the bot at https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=943286355281207347&permissions=1249785670769&scope=bot and select a server. 

## Starting the bot 
Pull and and run main.py in https://replit.com/join/kbtdgynilq-gonzalomanuelma. A future version will allow the bot to run forever, but for now the bot must be manually booted after one hour of inactivity. The replit acts as a server so that it depends on no computer and can be turned on/off from anywhere. 

## Using the bot 
All commands are prefixed by an $ symbol. 

### Debugging
- $hello: greets the user 
- $inspire: replies with a motivational phrase 
- $csxp add [username] [int]: adds CSXP to a given user, even if it doesn't exist 

### CSXP 
CSXP refers to Computer Society's Experience Points. CSXP can be tracked by, awarded to or removed from any user in the server where the bot has been set up. 
- $csxp: replies with the sender's current CSXP.
